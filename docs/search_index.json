["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction In the image above, you will see the average annual unemployment rates for four countries. This measures the percent of people who cannot find a job in the group of those people either working or looking for work. This is measured as \\[ \\text{Unemployment Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Unemployed}}{\\text{Unemployed} + \\text{Employed}} \\times 100 \\] This material will accompany (Taylor and Weerapana 2018) which will be the primary book for the course. We will also be using (The CORE Team 2020c), and the other materials compiled by CORE including (The CORE Team 2020b) and (The CORE Team 2020a) which act as useful comparisons to the more traditional material presented in (Taylor and Weerapana 2018). In recent months the COVID-19 crisis has gripped the world and put our global economy in a precarious position. As we can see from Figures 1.1 and 1.2 people who are newly jobless and travel in the U.S. have moved dramatically in opposite directions. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Figure 1.1: Jobless Claims Skyrocket in 2020 Figure 1.2: Travel Collapses in 2020 Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!
